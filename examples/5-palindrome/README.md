# Palindrome

For this exercise you will write a program that detects if a word is a palindrome or not.

Here are the steps the program should take:

1. Prompt the user to input a word.
2. Read in the user's input.
3. Check if the input is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same when read both forwards and backwards. Some examples:

- Bob
- Radar
- Racecar
- Noon
- Kayak
- Civic

For some more examples, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUQDzj6R3p4).

For this exercise, you can assume the user input will only be lowercase words. For an extended challenge, write your program to handle phrases with spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
