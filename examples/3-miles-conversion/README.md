# Miles Conversion

For this exercise you will write a simple program that converts a number of miles into three other units: meters, feet, and inches.

- Prompt the user to input the number of miles.
- Read in the value input by the user and store it in a variable with a `double` data type.
- Display the number of miles input by the user and the conversion into each of the three other units of measure.
- Use 2 decimal places of precision.

The output must match exactly as shown in the example below:

```
123.00 miles is equal to:
	649440.00 feet
	197949.31 meters
	7793280.00 inches
```

Use a tab character to indent the lines displaying feet, meters, and inches.
